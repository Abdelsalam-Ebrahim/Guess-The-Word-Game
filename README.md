## Guess The Word Game

**Guess The Word** is a fun and interactive word-guessing game where players attempt to discover a hidden word within five tries. Each guess must be a valid word, and after submitting a guess, the game provides feedback on the correctness of each letter in the word.

### How It Works:
- The game consists of a grid where players can make up to five guesses to find the correct word.
- After each guess, the game will provide visual feedback using color-coded hints:
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow Circle:** The letter is correct and in the correct position.
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Green Circle:** The letter is correct but in the wrong position.
  - âš« **Black Circle:** The letter is not in the word at all.
- Players can use the feedback to refine their guesses and ultimately uncover the hidden word.

### Features:
- **Check Word:** After typing your guess, click the `Check Word` button to see how close you are to finding the word.
- **Hints:** Stuck on a word? Use the `2 Hints` button to get additional clues and improve your chances of guessing the word.

This game is perfect for improving your vocabulary and problem-solving skills while having fun!
